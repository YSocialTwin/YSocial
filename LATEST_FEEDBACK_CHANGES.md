# Latest Dashboard UI Improvements

## Changes Made (Commit 1361ee7)

This document summarizes the latest changes made in response to the second round of feedback from @GiulioRossetti.

## 1. ✅ Improved Experiment Name Visualization

**Issue**: Need to make experiment name distinctive without using bold.

**Solution**: Applied distinctive styling to experiment names:
- **Font size**: Increased to `1.1em` (10% larger than surrounding text)
- **Color**: Changed to `#039be5` (template primary color)
- **Text decoration**: Removed underline (`text-decoration: none`)
- Maintains clickability as a link

**Before:**
```html
<a href="...">{{ experiment.exp_name }}</a>
```

**After:**
```html
<a href="..." style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #039be5; text-decoration: none;">
    {{ experiment.exp_name }}
</a>
```

**Visual Impact**: The experiment name now stands out with a larger size and distinctive blue color that matches the template's primary palette, making it easy to identify at a glance without appearing overly bold.

## 2. ✅ Hidden Disabled Controls

**Issue**: Avoid showing disabled controls - only show buttons that can be effectively clicked.

**Solution**: Refactored both experiment and client controls to use conditional rendering instead of showing disabled buttons.

### Experiment Controls

**Before** (showing all controls, some disabled):
```html
<a href="...">Run</a>  <!-- always shown -->
<a href="...">Stop</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when not running -->
<a href="...">Load</a>  <!-- always shown -->
<a href="...">Join</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when status != 1 -->
<a href="...">Delete</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when status == 1 -->
```

**After** (only showing enabled controls):
```html
{% if experiment.running == 0 %}
    <a href="...">Run</a>
{% endif %}
{% if experiment.running == 1 %}
    <a href="...">Stop</a>
{% endif %}
<a href="...">Load</a>  <!-- always available -->
{% if experiment.status == 1 %}
    <a href="...">Join</a>
{% endif %}
{% if experiment.status == 0 %}
    <a href="...">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```

**Control Visibility Rules:**
- **Run**: Only shown when experiment is not running (`running == 0`)
- **Stop**: Only shown when experiment is running (`running == 1`)
- **Load**: Always shown (always available)
- **Join**: Only shown when experiment is loaded (`status == 1`)
- **Delete**: Only shown when experiment is not loaded (`status == 0`)

### Client Controls

**Before** (showing all controls, some disabled):
```html
<a href="...">Run/Resume</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when running or exp not running -->
<a href="...">Pause</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when not running -->
<a href="...">Delete</a>  <!-- always shown, disabled when running -->
```

**After** (only showing enabled controls):
```html
{% if client.status == 0 and experiment.running == 1 %}
    {% if client_execution exists and elapsed_time == 0 %}
        <a href="...">Run</a>
    {% elif elapsed_time > 0 and elapsed_time < expected_duration %}
        <a href="...">Resume</a>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if client.status == 1 %}
    <a href="...">Pause</a>
{% endif %}
{% if client.status == 0 %}
    <a href="...">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```

**Control Visibility Rules:**
- **Run/Resume**: Only shown when:
  - Client is stopped (`client.status == 0`)
  - Experiment is running (`experiment.running == 1`)
  - Shows "Run" for new execution, "Resume" for partial completion
- **Pause**: Only shown when client is running (`client.status == 1`)
- **Delete**: Only shown when client is stopped (`client.status == 0`)

## Benefits

### 1. Cleaner Interface
- Reduced visual clutter by hiding unavailable actions
- User focuses only on actions they can actually perform

### 2. Improved UX
- No confusion about which buttons can be clicked
- Consistent with JupyterLab controls pattern (already implemented)
- Clearer action states

### 3. Better Visual Hierarchy
- Experiment names stand out with distinctive color and size
- Controls are more streamlined and purposeful

## Visual Comparison

### Experiment Controls

**Before:**
```
[Experiment Name] [Lab Status]
[▶ Run] [■ Stop (disabled)] [⊞ Load] [+ Join (disabled)] [× Delete (disabled)]
```

**After (when not running):**
```
Experiment Name [Lab Status]  ← larger, blue
[▶ Run] [⊞ Load] [× Delete]
```

**After (when running):**
```
Experiment Name [Lab Status]  ← larger, blue
[■ Stop] [⊞ Load]
```

**After (when loaded):**
```
Experiment Name [Lab Status]  ← larger, blue
[▶ Run] [⊞ Load] [+ Join]
```

### Client Controls

**Before:**
```
Client Name [Progress Bar] [▶ Run (disabled)] [⏸ Pause (disabled)] [× Delete]
```

**After (when stopped, experiment running):**
```
Client Name [Progress Bar] [▶ Run] [× Delete]
```

**After (when running):**
```
Client Name [Progress Bar] [⏸ Pause]
```

**After (when stopped, experiment not running):**
```
Client Name [Progress Bar] [× Delete]
```

## Implementation Details

### Changed Logic

1. **Conditional Rendering**: Changed from showing all buttons with conditional `disabled` class to conditional `{% if %}` blocks
2. **No Disabled States**: Removed all `disabled` class applications
3. **Simplified Tooltip Logic**: Tooltips always show action names since buttons only appear when clickable

### Maintained Functionality

- All original functionality preserved
- Same URL endpoints and actions
- Same state logic for determining button availability
- Progress bar and other features unchanged

## Testing

- ✅ All 21 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ No regressions detected
- ✅ Code formatted with black and isort
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Files Modified

- `y_web/templates/admin/dashboard.html` - Updated experiment name styling and control visibility logic

## Summary

Both requested improvements have been implemented:
1. ✅ Experiment names are now distinctive with larger font (1.1em) and template primary color (#039be5)
2. ✅ Disabled controls are hidden - only clickable buttons are shown for both experiments and clients

The dashboard now has a cleaner, more focused appearance that improves usability by removing visual clutter and making it clear which actions are available at any given time.
