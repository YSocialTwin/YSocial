# Infinite Scrolling Implementation

This document describes the infinite scrolling feature implemented for YSocial.

## Overview

Infinite scrolling has been implemented across all public pages that display tweets/posts, replacing the traditional next/previous button pagination system.

## Pages Updated

The following pages now support infinite scrolling:

1. **Feed Page** (`/feed`) - Main microblogging feed
2. **Reddit-style Feed** (`/rfeed`) - Forum-style feed
3. **Hashtag Posts** (`/hashtag_posts/<id>`) - Posts filtered by hashtag
4. **Interest Posts** (`/interest/<id>`) - Posts filtered by interest
5. **Emotion Posts** (`/emotion/<id>`) - Posts filtered by emotion
6. **Profile Posts** (`/profile/<id>`) - User profile timeline

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New API Endpoints (main.py)

Added 6 new JSON API endpoints that return post data:

- `GET /api/feed/<user_id>/<timeline>/<mode>/<page>` - Feed posts
- `GET /api/rfeed/<user_id>/<timeline>/<mode>/<page>` - Reddit feed posts
- `GET /api/hashtag_posts/<hashtag_id>/<page>` - Hashtag posts
- `GET /api/interest/<interest_id>/<page>` - Interest posts
- `GET /api/emotion/<emotion_id>/<page>` - Emotion posts
- `GET /api/profile/<user_id>/<mode>/<page>` - Profile posts

Each endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "posts": [...],
  "has_more": true/false
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### JavaScript Implementation (infinite-scroll.js)

Created a new JavaScript module that:

1. **Uses IntersectionObserver API** - Modern, efficient way to detect when user scrolls near bottom
2. **Loads posts incrementally** - Fetches next page when user approaches end of content
3. **Shows loading indicators** - Displays loader while fetching new posts
4. **Handles errors gracefully** - Shows error messages if loading fails
5. **Prevents duplicate requests** - Manages state to avoid multiple simultaneous requests

Key features:
- Configurable threshold for when to load more content
- Debouncing to prevent excessive API calls
- Loading state management
- End-of-content detection
- Error handling with user feedback

#### Template Updates

Updated 6 templates to:
1. Wrap posts in containers with unique IDs
2. Include the infinite-scroll.js script
3. Initialize infinite scrolling with appropriate configuration
4. Keep old pagination buttons hidden for graceful degradation

Templates modified:
- `feed.html`
- `reddit/feed.html`
- `hashtag.html`
- `interest.html`
- `emotions.html`
- `profile.html`

## User Experience

### Before
- Users had to click "Next Page" button to see more posts
- Page reload required for each navigation
- Limited to seeing one page at a time
- Jarring experience with full page reloads

### After
- Posts automatically load as user scrolls
- Seamless, continuous browsing experience
- No page reloads required
- Modern, responsive feel similar to popular social media platforms

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience** - Seamless scrolling without interruptions
2. **Better Performance** - Only loads content when needed
3. **Mobile-Friendly** - Works great on touch devices
4. **Modern Standards** - Uses latest web APIs (IntersectionObserver)
5. **Backward Compatible** - Old URLs with page numbers still work
6. **Accessible** - Maintains keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Security

- All API endpoints are protected with `@login_required` decorator
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced (verified by CodeQL)
- Existing URL redirection issues in unrelated code remain (pre-existing)
- XSS prevention through HTML escaping in JavaScript

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation uses:
- IntersectionObserver API (supported in all modern browsers)
- Fetch API for AJAX requests
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

Graceful degradation: If JavaScript is disabled or browser doesn't support features, users can still use direct URL navigation with page numbers.

## Testing

- All existing tests pass
- No syntax errors in Python or JavaScript code
- CodeQL security scan completed with no new issues
- Routes verified to exist and be accessible

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Add scroll position restoration when navigating back
2. Implement virtualization for very long feeds
3. Add pull-to-refresh on mobile
4. Cache loaded posts in localStorage
5. Add animations for new post insertion
6. Implement scroll-to-top button for long feeds
