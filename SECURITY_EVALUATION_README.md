## 🔄 Upgrade Process

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Estimated: 1-2 days)
```bash
pip install --upgrade 'Flask>=3.0.3' 'Werkzeug>=3.0.3' 'Jinja2>=3.1.4'
python run_tests.py
pytest y_web/tests/test_security_upgrades.py -v
```

### Phase 2: Security Libraries (Estimated: 1 day)
```bash
pip install --upgrade 'cryptography>=42.0.8' 'pyOpenSSL>=24.3.0'
python run_tests.py
pytest y_web/tests/test_security_upgrades.py -v
```

### Phase 3: Supporting Libraries (Estimated: 0.5 days)
```bash
pip install --upgrade 'pillow>=10.4.0' 'requests>=2.32.3'
python run_tests.py
pytest y_web/tests/test_security_upgrades.py -v
```

**Total Estimated Time:** 3-4 days including testing and documentation

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
1. **Run all existing tests:** `python run_tests.py`
   - Expected: 7/7 test files passing
   - Expected: 69 individual tests passing

2. **Run security validation tests:** `pytest y_web/tests/test_security_upgrades.py -v`
   - Expected: 21 tests passing
   - Expected: 4 tests skipped (version checks, will pass after upgrade)

### Manual Tests
- User registration and login
- Admin dashboard access
- Agent/population creation
- Social interactions (follow, share, react, publish)
- PostgreSQL connection (if applicable)

---

## 📝 Test Suite Details

### New Security Test Suite: `test_security_upgrades.py`

**Test Classes:**
1. `TestDependencyVersions` - Validates package versions meet security requirements
2. `TestFlaskCompatibility` - Tests Flask 3.0 compatibility
3. `TestCryptographyCompatibility` - Tests cryptography library
4. `TestRequestsCompatibility` - Tests requests library
5. `TestPillowCompatibility` - Tests Pillow image library
6. `TestSessionSecurity` - Tests session handling security
7. `TestDatabaseSSLConnection` - Tests database SSL connections
8. `TestPreUpgradeBaseline` - Documents current state
9. `TestFullStackIntegration` - Integration tests

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Tests both pre-upgrade and post-upgrade states
- ✅ Documents current versions
- ✅ Validates security features
- ✅ Tests compatibility
- ✅ Skips version checks until upgrade is done

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Breaking Changes
- **Flask 3.0** has some breaking changes but they're minimal
- **Werkzeug 3.0** works closely with Flask 3.0
- **Other packages** have minimal breaking changes

### Database
- ✅ No schema changes required
- ✅ SQLAlchemy 1.4.31 is compatible
- ✅ Both SQLite and PostgreSQL work
- ⚠️ Consider upgrading to SQLAlchemy 2.0 long-term

### Deployment
- Update Docker images after upgrade
- Test in staging environment first
- Have rollback plan ready
- Update documentation

---

## 🚀 Success Criteria

The upgrade is successful when:
- [x] All 69 existing tests pass
- [ ] All 21 security validation tests pass (4 currently skipped, will pass after upgrade)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed
- [ ] PostgreSQL SSL connections verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No performance regression observed

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Tests Fail After Upgrade
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Refer to Section 8 of DEPENDABOT_SECURITY_EVALUATION.md (Expected Behavior Changes)
3. Check if it's a known breaking change
4. Review test logs for specific issues

### If Application Doesn't Start
1. Check configuration files
2. Verify database connections
3. Check for import errors
4. Review Flask/Werkzeug deprecation warnings

### If Need to Rollback
```bash
pip install -r requirements_backup.txt
python run_tests.py
```
