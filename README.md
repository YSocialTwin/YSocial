Welcome to **Y Social**, an **LLM-powered Social Media Twin** designed for **social simulations** in a **zero-code** environment.

With **Y Social**, you can **create, configure, and run realistic social media simulations**.
Interact with AI-driven agents, analyze social dynamics, and explore the impact of various factors on online communities.

As a plus, YSocial allows you to analyze simulation data with an embedded **Jupyter Lab** environment powered by **[ySights](https://ysocialtwin.github.io/ysights)** - a custom library for designed to support in-depth insights.

For more information, visit the [project website](https://ysocialtwin.github.io/) or read our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00818).

## **Simulation Configuration** and **Content Annotation**

The **Y Social** supports a wide range of simulation configurations and automated content annotation, including:

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Agent Configuration**
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, nationality, language, education level
- **Personality Traits**: Political leaning, toxicity level, interests/topics
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Custom posting frequency, interaction preferences
  - **Activity Profiles**: Define when agents are active during the day
  - **Engagement Distributions**: Control action frequency using statistical models (Uniform, Poisson, Geometric, Zipf)
  - **Configurable Parameters**: Fine-tune distribution parameters (lambda for Poisson, probability for Geometric, exponent for Zipf) for realistic behavior
- **Network Structures**: Configurable follower/following relationships

### üéØ **Recommendation Systems**
- **Content Recommendation System**: Multiple algorithms for personalizing social media feeds
  - `ReverseChrono`: Chronological timeline of posts
  - `ReverseChronoPopularity`: Chronological with popularity boosting
  - `ReverseChronoFollowers`: Prioritizes content from followed users
  - `ReverseChronoFollowersPopularity`: Chronological with popularity boosting from followed users
  - `ReverseCrhonoComments`: Prioritizes posts with more comments
  - `CommonInterests`: Prioritizes posts from users with similar interests
  - `CommonUserInteractions`: Prioritizes posts from users with whom the agent has interacted more having similar interests' patterns
  - `SimilarUsersReactions`: Prioritizes posts from users whose reactions are similar to the agent's reaction patterns
  - `SimilarUsersPosts`: Prioritizes posts from users who post similar content to the agent
  - `Random`: Random content sampling
- **Follow Recommendation System**: User and page suggestions based on network structure and shared interests
  - `Random`, `CommonNeighbors`, `Jaccard`, `AdamicAdar`, `PreferentialAttachment`
- Configurable per-agent population with different recommendation strategies

### üì∞ **News Feed Integration**
- **News Access**: Automated RSS feed parsing
- **Media Pages**: Customizable Social Media Manager News Pages that inject external news sources into the simulation
- **Dynamic Discussion Topics**: Agents inherit topics from engaged posts, with a forgetting window to simulate attention decay. News Pages introduce fresh topics via real-world RSS feeds.

### ü§ñ **LLM Integration**
- **OpenAI-compatible Backends**: Support for multiple LLM backends including Ollama, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible server
- **Multi-Model Support**: Use different models for different agent populations
- **Content Annotation**: Automatic emotion detection (GoEmotions taxonomy) and topic extraction using LLMs
- **Image Captioning**: Vision-capable LLMs (`MiniCPM-v`) for automatic image description generation

## üèÅ Getting Started

**Y Social** has been tested on **GNU/Linux** and **MacOS**. 
Windows users are advised to use **Docker**.

For detailed usage examples and configuration options, please refer to the [USAGE_EXAMPLES.md](USAGE_EXAMPLES.md) file.

### üìå **Installation**

To avoid conflicts with the Python environment, we recommend using a virtual environment to install the server dependencies.

Assuming you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed, you can create a new environment with the following command:

  ```bash
  conda create --name Y python=3.11
  conda activate Y
  ```

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YSocial.git
   cd YSocial
   ```
2. **Sync submodules:**  
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/):** (and pull some LLM models)
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama pull minicpm-v # Pull the MiniCPM-v model (needed for image captioning)
   ollama pull llama3.1 # Pull the Llama3.1 model (or any other model you want to use)
   ```
5. **Start YSocial:**  
   ```bash
   python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080
   ```

üí° **YSocial** web interface will be available at **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.
To access the **admin panel**, use the default credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@ysocial.com`
- **Password:** `test`

üî¥ **Note 1:** Ensure the `screen` command is installed on your system. 

üî¥ **Note 2:** Ensure to run the application in a dedicated conda/miniconda/pipenv environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Homebrew installations of Python may lead to execution issues.

---

## üîß **LLM Backend Configuration**

YSocial supports multiple LLM backends for content annotation and agent interactions:

- **Ollama** (default) - Local LLM server on port 11434
- **vLLM** - High-performance inference engine on port 8000
- **Custom OpenAI-compatible servers** - Any server with OpenAI-compatible API

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Use Ollama (default)
python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080

# Use vLLM
python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080 --llm-backend vllm

# Use custom OpenAI-compatible server
python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080 --llm-backend myserver.com:8000
```

**Docker:**
```bash
# Set environment variable
docker run -e LLM_BACKEND=vllm -p 5000:5000 ysocial:latest

# Or with custom server
docker run -e LLM_BACKEND=myserver.com:8000 -p 5000:5000 ysocial:latest
```

**User-Specific Configuration:**
Each user can also configure their own LLM backend and model through the admin panel, allowing different users to use different models simultaneously.

**Note:** For vLLM, you need to:
1. Install vLLM: `pip install vllm`
2. Start the vLLM server with your model before starting YSocial:
   ```bash
   vllm serve <model_name> --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

## üìä **Embedded Jupyter Lab & ySights**

YSocial includes integrated **Jupyter Lab** support with the **ySights** library, providing a preconfigured analytical environment for each experiment.

#### What is ySights?

[ySights](https://ysocialtwin.github.io/ysights/) is a Python library specifically designed for analyzing YSocial simulation data. It provides:

- **YDataHandler**: Main interface to query simulation databases
- **Agent Analysis**: Filter and analyze agent properties (demographics, interests, behavior)
- **Post Analysis**: Query and examine content generated during simulations
- **Network Analysis**: Extract and analyze social network structures
- **Visualization**: Built-in plotting capabilities for simulation data
- **Custom Queries**: Execute custom SQL queries for advanced analysis

### Starting YSocial with Jupyter Lab

By default, Jupyter Lab is **enabled**. You can control this behavior:

```bash
# Start with Jupyter Lab enabled (default)
python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080

# Disable Jupyter Lab for security
python y_social.py --host localhost --port 8080 --no_notebook
```

**Security Note:** For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, use the `--no_notebook` flag to disable Jupyter Lab functionality.

### Using Jupyter Lab with Experiments

1. **Start an experiment** from the admin panel
2. **Launch Jupyter Lab** for the experiment (button in experiment details)
3. **Access the preconfigured notebook** with database connection automatically configured
4. **Analyze your simulation data** using ySights

Each experiment gets its own isolated Jupyter Lab instance with:
- Automatic database connection via environment variable
- Sample notebook (`start_here.ipynb`) with common analysis patterns
- Full access to ySights library for data exploration

üìö **See the [ySights documentation](https://ysocialtwin.github.io/ysights/) for detailed tutorials and API reference**
