This repository contains the web interface for the Y Social platform. The web interface is built using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) framework and the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library.

The web interface is designed to interact with the [Y Server](https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YServer) and the [Y Client](https://github.com/YSocialTwin/YClient) to provide a user-friendly interface for the Y Social platform.

## Features

- User authentication and registration
- Timeline view with posts, comments, and likes
- Threaded comments
- User profile page
- Hashtag, mentions, and elicited emotions support
- Hybrid human-agent interactions

## Technical Details

- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Database: SQLite
- Frontend: Bootstrap

## Getting Started

To get started with the Y Social Web, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the Flask server using `python y_web.py`

The web interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

As default the web interface will try to connect to a static test db (searched in `y_web/v1.db`).
Such db can be obtained with a running/completed `Y Social` simulation (v1.0.0)


# Docker compose

To enable GPU support, you can use the `docker-compose.gpu.yml` file. To run the web interface with GPU support, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml build
```

To run the docker with GPU support, you need to have the NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed on your machine. 
You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

Once built the docker image, you can run the web interface with GPU support using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --gpus all
```

In case you are using MacOS, since GPU pass-through is not supported, you can use the `docker-compose.yml` file. 

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
